Hello. I'm Changgyu Lee, a front-end developer. ðŸ‘½
I am currently working at NCSOFT to create operational tools for game development.
With development experience in various domains such as finance, manufacturing, and advertising, I focus on quickly identifying and solving business needs.

In my opinion, a good developer should be able to make a team scalable and productive, and provide direction to team and organizational challenges through active communication.
I find it rewarding to solve problems by refining and discussing different ideas to achieve a goal, and I aspire to be a developer who develops services that serve a purpose for users.
